# Recap on Aims

## Aim 1

### Validate a sub-millimeter diffuse reflectance spectroscopy probe for endoscopic determination of perfusion

--

- This aim involved designing a miniature diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) 
  probe for endoscopic quantification of saturation ( $StO_2$), oxyhemoglobin ( $HbO_2$) and
  total hemoglobin ( $tHb$) in an azoxymethane model of colon cancer (CRC)
  
--

## Can we endoscopically use DRS  in  a mouse model?

--

## **Status: Completed**

---
class:

## Aim 2

### Longitudinally determine response to different NAC regimens in primary murine colorectal tumors and correlation with tissue biomarkers

--
### Using different chemotherapy regimens:

--
  - Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)
--
  - Metronomic (MET)
--
  - Control (saline)
--

## Do different treatment regimens change perfusion metrics in a primary CRC model? 

--

## Status: 75%

---
## Aim 2

### Final group of MTD mice to be completed by November. MET and CG groups are completed.


---
## Aim 3

### Determine the temporal correlation of DRS-derived perfusion markers and the expression of pro-angiogenic genes in different NAC regimens

--

- This aim tries to contextualize the results from Aim 2 with pro-angiogenic biomarkers
--

- Uses RT-qPCR to quantify relative mRNA expression

## Status: 65%

### - mRNA extraction and primers have been optimized

### - qPCR has been run for CG and MG samples
